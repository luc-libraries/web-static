# Library legacy website files

Some systems (e.g. ILLiad) have need of files from the legacy Drupal website.  Might as well host them.

I have stripped all PHP files, all modules and includes, themes, libraries, drupal backups, and other files only relevant to a Drupal/PHP installation: trying to reduce size and risk.  It's possible I removed too many, but probably it's OK.

The remaining files might be useful for maintaining links to legacy static files (when known).  Still too many in here, but I don't have further bandwidth for this right now.
